TaoBank is a decentralized borrowing protocol that allows you to draw interest-free loans against $wTAO used as collateral. Loans are facilitated in $taoUSD (a low-volatility stablecoin soft-pegged to the US dollar) and need to maintain an overcollateralized ratio. TaoBank as a protocol is non-custodial, immutable, and governance-free. Learn more in our [documentation](https://docs.taobank.ai/).
